## Avon Shop

# Ideal Idea = "One person/admin or owner of the shop can only add products to his/her online shop
# and other visitors can go through the products and add those products to their cart and purchase them

# Implemented portion = Currently anyone logged in , can add products to the database
# And they can edit, delete those products from the product database

# Future tasks :: other users can only add their desired products to cart 
# and they can only edit their quantity in the cart and remove that product if they do not want to purchase

# Pictures stored in google drive and the ids of those pictures stored in the product resource in the backend
